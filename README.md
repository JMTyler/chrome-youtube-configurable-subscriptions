YouTube - Configurable Subscriptions
Chrome Extension

The goal of this extension is to act somewhat like a YouTube-specific RSS feed reader, allowing more fine-grained control
over your subscriptions than just this channel or that channel.  The user should be able to enter various forms of search
criteria (e.g. only videos uploaded by a specific channel and including "let's play" in the title).  Using these fine-grained
"subscriptions," the user should be able to receive notifications and see how many unwatched videos they have for a given
series on a given channel.  The user should also be able to sort these unwatched videos by various criteria and save that
sort method to that particular subscription.  The user should also be able to select whether or not to display videos they
have already watched on a per-subscription basis.
